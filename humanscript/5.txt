Task BYWV: The After Image, adding messages

// part 1

- fork https://github.com/dglittle/TheAfterImage

- put these instructions, and the subject line of this message, in a new file in the "humanscript" directory (create this directory if it doesn't exist)

// part 2

- open app.js
- look at apiCall
- note that it assumes q is an array of "commands"
- assume instead that q is a single command object, and remove the for loop

- modify 'add task' command so that it stores a reference to the current user in a field of the Task object called 'user'
- if no user is logged in, this command should fail

- add an 'add message' command
    - it should create a Message object with
        - text of message
        - reference to task (this should be a parameter)
        - reference to user (person sending the message, not a parameter)
        - command should fail if no user is logged in

- add a 'get messages' command, which takes parameter 'task'
    - returns json array of all messages for the given task

- test this
    - run it somewhere
    - log in
    - create a task
    - create a message
    - invoke 'get messages'
    - take screenshot, including address bar
    - take screenshot
    - put screenshot in "humanscript/output"

// last part

- commit and push to github
- make pull request to original repository
- respond to this thread saying "done"
