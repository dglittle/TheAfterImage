// part 0

- if you have time to do this task right now, reply-all to this message saying "got it" (only the first person to say "got it" should do it)

- when you log time, use the subject line of this task as the message

// part 1

- fork https://github.com/dglittle/TheAfterImage

- put these instructions, and the subject line of this message, in a new file in the "humanscript" directory (create this directory if it doesn't exist)

// part 2

- remove mongoose module
- add mongous module
- remove db.js
- in app.js...
- remove
    var User = require('./db.js').User;
    var Task = require('./db.js').Task;
    var Message = require('./db.js').Message;
- somewhere add "ObjectID = require("mongous/bson/bson.js").ObjectID"    
- in apiCall
    - at Task.create...
        - do this with mongous (use "Task" collection)
        - instead of setting "user : req.currentUser.OpenId"
            set "user : req.currentUser._id"
            (this may require using the ObjectId constructor, not sure)
    - at Message.create...
        - do this with mongous (use "Message" collection)
        - assume that c.task will be an ObjectId represented as a hex-string,
            so it will need to be converted to a real ObjectId
        - do the same thing with user as above
    - at Task.find...
        - do this with mongous
    - at Message.find...
        - do this with mongous
- at app.get('/verify')
    - do the stuff with "User" using mongous (use "User" collection)

- test this
    - run it somewhere
    - log in
    - create a task
    - list tasks
    - remember task _id of a task
    - create a message
    - invoke 'get messages'
    - take screenshot, including address bar
    - put screenshot in "humanscript/output"

// last part

- commit and push to github
- make pull request to original repository
- respond to this thread saying "done"
